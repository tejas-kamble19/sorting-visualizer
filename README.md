# sorting-visualizer
A Sorting Algorithm Visualizer is an interactive desktop app that animates how classic sorting algorithms rearrange data, helping learners see the step‑by‑step logic and measure performance in real time. It is useful for building strong foundations in algorithms, UI thinking, and computational analysis without requiring any login or paid services.
